![Sketch Select Similar Layers](http://wessley.me/images/SelectSimilarLayersPlugin.png)

Inspired by Illustrator's "Select Similar Objects" feature, **Select Similar Layers** is a Sketch plugin that selects the other layers with the same attributes as the one you've currently selected. It works with fill color, border color, border thickness, font, opacity or blending mode.

Just select a layer and hit:
- **⌃⌥1 (ctrl+alt+1)** to select layers with the same **fill color**.
- **⌃⌥2 (ctrl+alt+2)** to select layers with the same **border color**.
- **⌃⌥3 (ctrl+alt+3)** to select layers with the same **border thickness**.
- **⌃⌥4 (ctrl+alt+4)** to select text layers with the same **font and size**.
- **⌃⌥5 (ctrl+alt+5)** to select layers with the same **opacity**.
- **⌃⌥6 (ctrl+alt+6)** to select layers with the same **blending mode**.

1. Download and unzip [Select Similar Layers](https://github.com/wonderbit/sketch-select-similar-layers/archive/master.zip)
